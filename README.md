# Sales-Software for a furniture store
In this project, I made a simple but functional program for a furniture store. You can register new salesmen, new products and keep track
of the sales. Also, you can remove a certain product or salesmen in a easy way. The purpose of this academic project is to use pointers and
files in the C programming language. I made this project using only standard libraries on C.
